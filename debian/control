Description: GUI tools for ROS - rxbag, rxplot, rxgraph, and others
 .
 This stack contains the packages:
 * rxtools: rxtools is two things. First it is a library of GUI widgets, written in wxWidgets, that can be embedded in other applications. Second, it is a set of GUI applications that view and manage ROS state. These GUI applications include rxconsole and rxplot. Pieces of rxtools use some icons from the Silk icon pack from famfamfam. These icons have a separate Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License. The source code for the software in this package is BSD.
 * rxbag: rxbag is a GUI tool for visualizing, inspecting and replaying histories of ROS messages. Some icons from the Silk icon pack are used, which is available from famfamfam.com.
 * xdot: XDot, by Jose Fonseca, is an interactive viewer for graphs written in Graphviz's dot language. This package adds front-end capabilities to XDot including WX Widget support and a mechanism for receiving callbacks when nodes are clicked. This extension is provided as BSD.
 * rxgraph: rxgraph is a command-line tool for visualizing a ROS computation graph. The rxgraph is a new package in ROS 1.1 that provides an updated version of the rxgraph tool that was originally distributed in the rosgraph package.
 * wxPython_swig_interface: Interface files used with SWIG to allow use of custom C++ widgets with wxPython code. These interface files were pulled from wxPython 2.8.1, because at the time that was the target version (since we were using Ubuntu Feisty). We will probably continue to use these interface files until they no longer work for some reason. The ideal situation would be if these were installed in system installs along with wxPython, but unfortunately they are not.
